General code style
-------

- use 2 space `indents` and 4 space `continuation indents` for Java and Kotlin, and 2 space for indents & continuation in XML, we're slowing moving to that
- try your best not to exceed horizontal line length
- don't include "created by" or any other tags at top of classes, if you find any please remove them
